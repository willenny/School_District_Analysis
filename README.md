# School District Analysis

## Overview
The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that their is evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth  She has asked me to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once I replaced the math and reading scores, Maria would requested me to repeat the school district analysis that I did in this module and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to highlight the differences that will occur in the student data and school data after math and reading scores of the ninth grade students in Thomas High School are removed. To help Maria present the information to the school board, I will show her the major differences between the districy summary, school summary, Thomas High School's performance relative to the other schools, math and reading scores bby grade, scores by school spending, scores by school size, and scores by school type.

## Results
-How is the district summary affected?
  - Due to there only being 461 ninth grade students in Thomas High School, out of the 39,170 (~1%), the removal of the reading and math scores did not have a large impact on any components of the district summary.
